# Cat-Dog-Classifier

Certainly! Here's an example README file for your cat and dog classifier project:

# Cat and Dog Classifier using TensorFlow

This project is a deep learning model that classifies images as either cats or dogs. It is built using TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning framework. The model is trained on a large dataset of cat and dog images and can accurately predict whether a given image contains a cat or a dog.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python 3.x and TensorFlow installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To classify an image as a cat or a dog, you can use the `classify_image.py` script. Here's an example of how to use it:

```bash
python classify_image.py --image_path /path/to/image.jpg
```

Replace `/path/to/image.jpg` with the path to the image you want to classify. The script will output the predicted class (cat or dog) along with the confidence score.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is not included in this repository due to its large size. However, you can create your own dataset or use publicly available datasets such as [Kaggle Cats and Dogs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/chetankv/dogs-cats-images).

The dataset should be organized into two folders: one for cat images and another for dog images. Each image should be in a separate file, and the folder structure should be as follows:

```
dataset/
    ├── cats/
    │   ├── cat001.jpg
    │   ├── cat002.jpg
    │   └── ...
    └── dogs/
        ├── dog001.jpg
        ├── dog002.jpg
        └── ...
```

## Model Architecture

The model architecture used in this project is a convolutional neural network (CNN) with multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. The exact architecture and hyperparameters can be found in the `model.py` file.

## Training

To train the model on your own dataset, you can use the `train.py` script. Make sure to update the paths and hyperparameters in the script according to your requirements.

```bash
python train.py
```

The script will load the dataset, preprocess the images, train the model, and save the trained model weights to a file.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the trained model, you can use the `evaluate.py` script. It will load the trained model weights and evaluate the accuracy on a separate test dataset.

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test dataset. The performance may vary depending on the quality and size of the dataset, as well as the chosen hyperparameters.

Here are some example predictions made by the model:

| Image         | Predicted Class | Confidence Score |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------|
| cat001.jpg    | Cat             | 0.95             |
| dog001.jpg    | Dog             | 0.80             |
| cat002.jpg    | Cat             | 0.92             |
| dog002.jpg    | Dog             | 0.85             |
